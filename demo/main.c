/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks.
 *
 * In addition to the standard tasks, main() creates two "Register Check" 
 * tasks.  These tasks write known values into every general purpose register,
 * then check each register to ensure it still contains the expected (written)
 * value.  The register check tasks operate at the idle priority so will get
 * repeatedly preempted.  A register being found to contain an incorrect value
 * following such a preemption would be indicative of an error in the context
 * switch mechanism.
 * 
 * Main.c also creates a task called "Check".  This only executes every three 
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each task (other than the "flash" tasks) maintains a unique count that is 
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should 
 * any error occur within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The 
 * check task inspects the count of each task to ensure it has changed since
 * the last time the check task executed.  If all the count variables have 
 * changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the check task
 * toggles the onboard LED.  Should any task contain an error at any time 
 * the LED toggle rate will change from 3 seconds to 500ms.
